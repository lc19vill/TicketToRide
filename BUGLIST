//if you buy the path between bremerhaveb and hamburg when you have a hamburg card it crashes



//niede to franfurt crashes
INTERESTING! It's only when connecting koln, and that place itself is causing glitches! 
//Koln works to frank, so it may be the connection to dusseldorf
//Dort to dussle works

yup, its dussle to koln. not the card, but the connection

//koln works as a start


//////////these were all due to typos in the locations lol... no problem though, at least it was easy to fix (hard to find tho hahah)
